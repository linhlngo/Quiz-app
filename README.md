# Quiz-app

n the second course project, you will build a web application that is used for creating and answering multiple-choice questions. The application allows creating multiple-choice questions that can then be answered by self and others. The application also shows some basic statistics, including the number of answers and the number of correct answers by the current user, the total number of times the questions created by the current user have been answered, and the five users with the most question answers. In addition, the application also provides an API for retrieving and answering random questions.

The application must use a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database). Furthermore, the application naturally needs to be built using the Deno and Oak.
